eduMessenger is a Moodle Messenger.

It can be connected to multiple Moodle-platforms simultaneously and shows a stream of forum posts and private messages in chronological order from all connected Moodle-platforms in one timeline. 

Additionally it offers the possibility to browse through courses and view course contents. Resources can be opened in the system webbrowser.

The eduMessenger requires the Moodle plugin [local_edumessenger](https://github.com/rschrenk/moodle-local_edumessenger) to work.
